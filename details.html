With it we try to represent our experience: a physical/digital compilation of mixed media, mixed methods, mixed writers, theories, and identities. The digital quilt you see here represents a physical quilt that we sewed as part of an upper division writing in the disciplines class, and the physical quilt represents our diverse embodied realities. Our immediate goal with this project is to contribute to ongoing conversations about critical making as composition pedagogy and provide pedagogical and practical implications for employing critical making in the writing classroom. Our larger goal is to solidify the connections between critical making and social justice, advancing critical making as social justice classroom praxis that answers the pedagogical and curricular needs of diverse student populations (Austin & Oseguera, 2004).

            "Who are we? We are quilters; but we started as an assistant professor of composition studies, two students in an upper division writing in the disciplines course, a student interested in social justice and undergraduate research, and a computer science student skilled at coding. In becoming quilters we have each defined our roles and identities in relationship to scholarship, writing, and critical making. Like the individual blocks of our physical quilt, we maintain our agency and autonomy in our separate goals and identities while still coming together to inform this project. Respectful of these quilting lessons and outcomes, this webtext represents our individual voices and experiences. As this work will argue, part of reframing composition through social justice maker projects is to broaden the scope of who counts and what counts as composer, expert, and authority. Thus, this article is a practice in that very work. The authors represent a \"quilting together,\" if you will, of voices, experiences, and expertise. True to quilting etiquette, the authors refuse the traditional genre of standard edited academic article and instead allow their individual writing to maintain its own style. The article itself, then, is also \"quilted composition:\" four voices, ideas, and experiences sewn together by transitions, section breaks, and collaborative effort, bound by the conventions of an academic article, and pieced together through coded webtext. Our shifts in voice, style, tone, and ideas are purposeful, even if at times awkward. We give credit to individual voices when necessary and come together as one when our ideas converge. ",
            "This digital quilt explores \"Quilting Composition\" through research and reflection. Although we invite you to interact with the quilt in your own way, our roles in the project determine what we write about. Kelly covers her classroom praxis. Leslie provides the history of quilting and textile arts and their relationship to rhetoric and composition, emphasizing their usefulness as social justice projects. Giana discusses textile arts and maker projects as composition classroom pedagogy, and her experience as a student and researcher. Alyssa looks at how quilting composition is social justice in practice, and reflects on the project. Erik codes our writing together into a digital quilt. We provide observations from our experiences throughout, as students, instructors, and researchers. Our broad goal is to show how quilting, when contextualized as rasquache maker project, is useful for teaching students about writing, but also for encouraging them to see the risks and rewards of writing in its myriad forms as a tool for social justice and advocacy.",

            "Kelly's Story: It was Semester's Eve in spring of 2018 and I sat facing my computer: Should I make the syllabus live now, or wait until we meet tomorrow? I'm guessing this is a familiar place for all instructors, but the spring of 2018 was especially poignant for me because somewhere between October 2017 and January 2018 I embarked on a crazy composition classroom adventure: I decided we would be quilting. Like, really quilting. Fabric, needles, thread—the whole thing. And not just once or twice, either: every week for the duration of the semester we would work towards the goal of making a class quilt. I scoured the names of the 26 students who were about to become part of my project. Should I wait until the students are in the classroom on the first day to spring the quilt idea? I decided to publish the materials early, so the students could see what to expect. Within two hours three students had dropped. By the end of the day the roster had shifted significantly. Students dropped, panicked last minuters added, and a core of the strong (or those that didn't bother to check) held fast. There was a low din when I entered the classroom the next day. It slowed as I started taking off my jacket and preparing. At 3:00 pm I began to introduce myself and welcome everyone to the class. I hadn't even broken into the syllabus when a hand shot up. \"Yes?\" I said, nervously, \"I'm sorry,\" said the student, \"are we really going to make a quilt in this class? This is GWAR right?\" \"Yes,\" I paused longer than I should have, \"this is GWAR. And we're making a quilt.\" Excited chatter as students turned to each other in disbelief. I laughed and said, \"hear me out…\" By the end of the two-hour class meeting everyone—myself included! - was skeptical, but on board. We were doing it! ",

            "Where did this idea come from? And how did it take shape as a social justice maker project? I used project-based and maker-based learning in my classes for years, but in fall of 2017 I attended a maker session at the Feminisms and Rhetorics conference led by Sonia Arellano where she discussed her own social justice quilting projects and took us through a bit of her inspiring work. Something clicked: what if instead of individual maker projects we worked towards a collaborative class project? Quilting seemed like the perfect medium to explore this idea. After Arellano's presentation, I started researching other sewing for social justice and maker projects across rhetoric and composition. I found inspiration in the syllabi of Malea Powell (2014), Sonia Arellano, and Jennifer Sano-Franchini (2019), and the theoretical work of Angela Haas (2012), Matt Ratto and Megan Boler (2014), Jodi Shipka (2011), and David Sheridan, Jim Ridolfo, and Anthony Michel (2012), who all encourage us to extend our definition of writing (and research) to include critical making. I also turned to my own experiences for inspiration. My dad raised me with a \"fix it or make it\" mentality that left a large streak of rasquachismo in me that finds its way into my academic work. Tomás Ybarra-Frausto (1989), theorizes rasquachismo as \"an underdog perspective - a view from los de abajo. An attitude rooted in resourcefulness and adaptability yet mindful of stance and style\" (p. 5). He argues that rasquachismo is \"visceral,\" an \"aesthetic display projecting a sort of visual biculturalism.\" Rasquache is both embodied as a sensibility (visceral) and an \"aesthetic,\" something visible and visual. It is more than just a method for creating art, rasquache is a theory and analysis of how and why art is made. A rasquache methodology accounts for both the invisible and the visible by attaching sensibility and aesthetic to the work of researching, making methodology tangible both as a bodily practice and visible representation of how rhetoric and composition research proceeds. Sarah Lowndes (2016) connects DIY projects back to rasquache, although she doesn't name it as such, stating, \"DIY activities are often carried out using an economy of means and materials, and exhibit what could be called an aesthetic of necessity\" (p. 263). I approached the quilt through rasquachismo, as I do most things.",
            "As I continued my search on quilting, critical making, and social justice, I found projects doing similar work here in the US, like the Social Justice Sewing Academy, The Migrant Quilt Project, and various work featured in Marsha MacDowell, et al.'s (2016) Quilts and Human Rights. I started thinking about the power of textile production as social action in its myriad forms, but I also started thinking about Cooperative Argumentation (Makau & Marty, 2001): the theoretical underpinnings for my department's GWAR class, and how it encourages students to engage the deliberative process as a framework for decision making. Quilting seemed to accomplish these multiple and diverse goals: It presented a way for students to work both individually (on their own quilt block) and as a group (to bring the whole quilt together). The work they engage in would help them make tangible the labor of research, the production of rhetorical artifacts, and see themselves as dynamic pieces of larger systems of labor, production, and audience. It also opened space for them to engage rhetoric in activism and consider the intersection of social justice and composing.",
            "With these ideas in mind, I hatched the plan of the quilt. As a class, we would spend all semester making a quilt.  The project would grow and change from an individual, to small group, to large group project. While we made the quilt, we'd talk about research, writing, rhetoric, social justice, and advocacy through the framework of cooperative argumentation.",

            "Quilting for social justice is rooted in the communities of people of the global majority (PGM) (see MacDowell 2016) (the authors use the more accurate PGM to decenter whiteness and challenge the demographic inaccuracy of \"minority\"). As a community of quilters we were eager to explore that history and transfer it to our project. One of our first observations was how quilting asks that you not be afraid to take up a sharp object (needle) and poke holes in what existed before to make new combinations through stitching, patching, and threading together. Many of our classroom conversations centered on these observations and their associated metaphors: If the pen is our needle, how do we make it just as sharp? If the needle is the pen, what is the thread? ",
            "Textiles have had and continue to play a prominent role in the lives of ethnic communities: wampum, huipiles, slave quilts and the AIDS Memorial Quilt (see Blair and Michel) are just a few common examples. Indigenous communities \"employed wampum belts as hypertextual technologies—as wampum belts have extended human memories and inherited knowledges through interconnected, nonlinear designs and associative storage and retrieval methods—long before the \"discovery\" of \"Western hypertext\" (Haas, 2007, p. 77). This positions Indigenous people as the \"first known skilled multimedia workers and intellectuals in the Americas\" (Haas, 2007, p. 78). To this community the \"wampum is a living rhetoric that communicates relationship between two or more parties\" as it has \"serve[d] as a sign of technology that has been used to record hundreds of years of alliances within tribes, between tribes, and between the tribal governments and colonial government\" (Haas, 2007, p. 78). Wampum belts \"extend human memories of inherited knowledge via interconnected, nonlinear designs with associative message storage and retrieval methods\" (Haas, 2007, p. 80-81).",
            "Like wampum, huipiles—a Guatemalan indigenous hand-embroidered textile and a traditional garment— \"can reveal age, sex, status, or it can state degrees of group membership and participation in different systems of beliefs, concealing individual identities in military uniforms or religious robes\" (Odland, 2006, p. 2). Since indigenous Guatemalan artists create huipiles with the purpose of being read, one can argue that the makers of these textiles write through multimodal textiles to share a message with readers, members of the community who can decode the symbols present in the textile. Odland supports Haas' research on wampum, further showing that indigenous communities have extensive traditions of multimodality. Odland (2006) states that \"because each community has developed its own style, form, pattern, and color that serve as symbols of identity and meaning, we can assume that the Maya have practiced their weaving traditions for a long time\" (p. 2). The huipil remains a \"cloth [with] unlimited potential for communication graphically and emblematically\" (Odland, 2006, p. 2). ",
            "Similar to cultural histories sewn into wampum and huipiles, quilts became an important piece of the fight against slavery in the United States. Organizers of the Underground Railroad quilted slave codes into quilts to help the enslaved navigate their way to freedom. In Hidden in Plain View: A Secret Story of Quilts and the Underground Railroad, authors Jacqueline Tobin and Raymond G. Dobard (2000) share their findings from a discussion with Ozella McDaniel Williams, a quilt maker from South Carolina. During the interview Williams \"told researchers that she memorized a secret code passed down by her ancestors that was used by the quilt makers before the Civil War to offer discreet clues to slaves who were trying to escape to freedom in the North\" (p. 44).  Tobin and Dobard (2000) \"believe that particular quilt squares which showed wrenches in a particular pattern or pointed in a particular direction were hung outside of slave housing to signal other slaves it was time to gather their tools and other belongings and try to escape\" (p. 44). ",
            "Wampum, huipiles, and slave quilts, among other textile forms of resistance, extend the fight for equity and justice for PGM communities. As a collective of social justice quilters, we thought about the history of textiles metaphorically as our thread: how can we use this history of active resistance to stitch together our own activisms? What other threads of resistance and activism could we bring together in our quilt and in our writing?",

            "Fabric is the foundation of the quilt. In essence, it is the quilt. Or, at least, it is what makes the tangible existence of the quilt possible.

This section covers the practicalities of planning and scheduling, and how  our institutional structure made this project possible. ",
            "(Kelly) The first thing I have to admit for this section is that I am blessed with long class meeting times, and so anyone thinking of adopting a similar project in their classroom will need to account for their classroom contact hours. GWAR is a four credit class that meets twice a week for two hours each meeting. I had four hours every week to split between covering course content and working on the quilt project. I split the two evenly: during our first two-hour class meeting of the week (Tuesday), we would do \"typical\" classroom activities: discuss assigned readings and materials, small and large group activities, peer reviews and workshops, and other supporting work. Tuesdays, in other words, were our content days. This worked well. Usually students (and instructors!) are more focused and energized during the beginning of the week, and it also gave students (and me!) a weekend to prep for a heavy day of content. ",
            "Thursdays, our second meeting of the week, became quilting days, or our \"applied learning\" days. The assignment sequence dictated the actual quilting activities for each quilting day (see \"Pins\"), which were further guided through discussion of transfer from the tangible material moves we were making to create our quilt and the content we had covered the previous Tuesday. I encouraged students to dialogue with each other about their quilt process, to collaborate and work as a collective, and also to bring in key themes, ideas, and metaphors from our course content. But, as much as I encouraged students to see these days as an extension and practice of our learning, I also wanted to emphasize them as days for self-care, reflection and meditation, mindfulness, and attention to mental health. I loved when students were eagerly engaged in conversations about how quilting mapped onto our learning, but I also equally enjoyed the days we spent sewing quietly to a playlist. ",
            "For one student, who quilted the \"Break the Stigma\" square, the purposeful attention to mental health and self care was an important part of the class because it reflected her chosen activism: mental health awareness. But, it wasn't just her that found these sewing days helpful. A number of my students commented on how much they looked forward to having time built into their busy schedules to focus on a relaxing and meditative activity. As we continue to think about how to make our classrooms more safe and equitable spaces, and how that in turn helps build a more mindful society, making time for wellness into our course structure increasingly emerges as a valuable practice (see for example Grese Owens et al, 2015). Splitting my course structure into content days and sewing days allowed me to tap into that potential, and our sewing days became the highlight of the week, every week. ",

Not only were they willing to donate two giant totes of fabric, two members of the guild also came to the class to guest lecture on how to get started with quilting and shared some of their art quilts with the students. Engaging the local community helped the quilt project feel that much more real. Our friends at the guild even came back to visit us once we finished the quilt.

            "To meet these goals, the assignments built in space for quilting, writing, researching, and reflection at three critical stages in the quilt's development: the individual quilt block, working with a small group to bring the individual quilt blocks together into a quilt section, and then joining those sections together into the larger class quilt. At each stage students had to pause and write. For the first assignment students had to figure out what they were passionate about and why, and then in the context of course readings, why they wanted to quilt about that \"passionate attachment\" (see Judith Butler). Although the social justice goals of the project were clear from the beginning students were told there were no wrong answers: they could choose whatever they truly felt passionate about. The variety in the quilt blocks speaks for itself, from Sex and the City to horror films to sports.",
            "Besides figuring out their passionate attachment and writing about it, students also had to quilt it. So, a second part of the first writing prompt also asked the students to reflect on their experiences quilting their passionate attachment. This is where so many excellent anecdotes about the process came from, like one student who accidentally sewed his square to his pants not once, but twice! When we discussed these experiences as a class, that student made astute observations about the writing process and the frustrations we all feel when the piece we are working on just isn't coming out how we first imagined. ",
            "The second assignment turned the focus from the individual to the group, grounding the students further in cooperative argumentation. For this part of the project, students had to work in a small group to stitch their quilt block to the quilt blocks of four to five of their classmates. They were tasked, as a group, with figuring out how to divide the labor so it was equal and fair. The writing prompt asked them to speak about the experience of sewing with their group, but it also challenged them to think about how their passionate attachments shifted and changed now that their squares were networked together with the passionate attachments of their group members. What happens when your Sex and the City square shares a border with an education square (for example)? What does that mean in the larger context of contemporary activisms and fights for justice? These are the kinds of questions I asked students to interrogate in their second writing project, where they also reflected on the deliberative process of their group work.",
            "The last assignment asked students to work together  as a large group to sew the quilt together and finish the binding. We spent time as a class negotiating the best way to arrange the quilt, the rules for sewing, and produced collaborative documents that acted as guides (see fig. 2). We divided the labor so that each student had a specific role, whether that was stitching quilt blocks together, a section of the binding, or the finishing touches of tying yarn to hold the quilt together. In their final writing assignment students had to reflect on the class negotiations, their specific role in finishing the quilt, and also how the meaning of their specific passionate attachment had changed or altered as a result of becoming part of a larger networked group of passionate attachments. For each written assignment students had to think about the stages of quilting and the writing process. At each stage we also stopped and took part in Socratic Seminars to discuss and reflect. ",

            "To contextualize this through story, here is one of my favorites. I decided early on that I wanted students to have as much ownership over the project as possible. So when we entered the small and large group sewing stages, we threw the quilt into a paper Safeway bag and it began traveling home with students so they could finish up their sewing. This required that we all trust and communicate with each other openly and honestly. One Thursday, a sewing day, a student who had taken the quilt home didn't show up. We were about fifteen minutes into class when it was clear he was not coming and we hadn't heard from him. I had nothing planned to replace our sewing activities for those days and moving content up a day made little sense since the students would not have done the reading yet. I didn't want to cancel, and students wanted to sew, so as a class we discussed our options and settled on: no pressure, but let's text him to make sure he is ok. Students who had been members of his group for the small group sewing stage of the project composed a text with the help of the class and we sent it. Even though we weren't quilting we were collaborating and working as a collective to problem solve. Within a few minutes we got a text back: \"I'm so sorry. I fell asleep!! I'll be right there!\" and sure enough, within ten minutes he was there with the quilt. Although we might have lost out on some sewing time, the lesson was even more important. It was exciting to work together as a class to overcome this obstacle and our intention in reaching out was not to guilt him into coming to class, but one of genuine care: you are a member of our quilting collective. Is everything okay? The student stayed to talk to me after class, apologized for being late, and thanked me for having his classmates text him. ",

            "Measuring again where this project fits in multimodal composition praxis, it's important to remind the reader that both our digital and physical quilts, the class itself, and all the labor that went into this production, are multimodal texts. Multimodality is a \"theory [that] offers a broadly semiotic approach to analyzing most communicative forms, including spoken and written language, still and moving images, sound, music, gesture, body posture, movement and the use of space, and so on\" (Bazalgette & Buckingham, 2012, p. 1). Multimodality encourages students to analyze information differently than traditional print texts do, since students not only have to analyze the words but also the images. Whether it's a video game, a little chat, or sewing a quilt, when used thoughtfully and purposefully, multimodality can lead to critical making and mean making.",
            "Critical making is \"positioned at the intersection of ‘scholarly' work of thinking and the material work of making; it serves as a catalyst for design, embedded in a process of craft, material, and exploration\" (Schwartz, 2016, p. 227). This means critical making is a way for scholars to make their work tangible and physical, making the products and processes of that work visible to larger audiences. Basically, it's like we're building our critical scholarly work into existence. Critical making is also \"a pedagogical construct in which students explore abstract concepts through the creation of physical things\" (Schwartz, 2016, p. 229). Because critical making makes the abstract parts of critical thinking more visible, it helps students learn better. An important component of critical making is mean-making.",
            "Mean-making is, according to Barbara Bird (2010), \"a construction through interpretive interactions with reading and writing\" (p. 1). Mean-making is making something after having interactions with texts, whether they be the tradition text kind or the multimodal kind. In Kelly's class we read and discussed articles. We learned through both multimodal texts and what Bazalgette and Buckingham (2012) call \"proper\" texts, meaning printed and/or written texts (p. 4). These texts helped us to create the quilt. The quilt was the product of our mean-making, and in turn, the quilt helped us mean-make in more robust and dynamic ways, since the quilt itself is multimodal. Jing Liu (2013) argues that visual texts, which are multimodal texts, can help with mean-making by stating, \"We live in an increasingly visual culture, image colors and other non-verbal resources are no longer used mainly to entertain and illustrate, rather, they are being significant in communicating and meaning-making\" (p. 1259). Multimodal texts are the way of the future, but that doesn't mean classrooms have to give up on proper texts. Rather, they can integrate multimodal texts with these proper texts. Students can learn from both without sacrificing significance or importance. ",

            "In quilting \"basting\" is a term used to describe quick, nonpermanent stitches meant to hold things together for the time being. While basting is a useful technique for keeping your fabric in order, it's not meant to hold up forever. Perhaps in the theory and practice of composition studies, particularly when we talk about racial equity and social justice in our writing classrooms, we have been doing a lot of basting but not a lot of sewing. We need more praxis. Change is needed in composition pedagogy, but it is still slow to come. Our social environments affect how we understand and engage with discourse and language (James, Ruiz & Sanchéz, 200), and there is still work to do in composition studies to recognize and support these differences. PGM students face challenges in composition studies because their dialects and home languages are not what we traditionally consider \"proper\" or \"correct.\" African American Vernacular English (AAVE), which was once referred to as ebonics, for example, is seen by many as an illegitimate form of communication because of the shortening of letters in words. The alphabetic language was and still is seen as a hallmark of civilization and an advancement of people (8), in the view of the higher education system, which is built on westernized European culture, AAVE does not fit into this. The differences in the ways of communication for people of color has not only been frowned upon for a long time, but viewed as inferior to Americanized English, and conditioned out of the education system, limiting the opportunities of showing the differences from an individual perspective and culturally in the classrooms. A project like this, that combines writing and the physical act of making something, like quilting, can manifest as an example of critical race theory, breaking the silence of a normalized discourse that has historically been used as a means of oppression against racial minorities in the U.S. (13). ",
            "What quilting allowed was the use of exploration through the creation of social text- representation of social experiences, resistance, and stories (Knowles & Cole, 2008). PGM communities continue to face widespread obstacles of underrepresentation of their culture. Their attempts at self-expression may not be fully understood from the perspective of those who do not share a similar experience within the same racial or ethnic group, neither from those who benefit from hierarchy social structures, and powerhouses within, for example, the education system. According to the American Council of Education, over 40% of college and university students comprise PGM, yet, less than 25% of the teacher administration is made up of PGM, leaving a dominant presence of white teachers who may lack the teaching practices that embrace different cultures. White teachers and students who come from a more affluent background are typically surrounded by other white people and not exposed to the daily underlying obstacles of what PGM students have and continue to face. \"Most White teachers have had little experience learning how to learn from someone else's community, yet this is exactly what they will need to do to build pedagogy that is culturally and contextually relevant to students from backgrounds different from their own\" (Sleeter, 2008). This quilting project provided students to express their feelings, thoughts, and a composition story that they could personally connect with. What quilting allowed was an opportunity for students to give a new meaning of what composition is, what it could be, and whose writing matters. ",

            "Quilting composition revises our ideas about what counts as writing, and part of building on this concept is figuring out what counts as critical making. For this project, we used quilting as the main subject of ‘media text'. Quilting was more than just sewing fabrics together, students could create something that had an impactful meaning to them called \"passionate attachments\". While recognizing their passionate attachments, it also required students to read and reflect on short passages that focused on personal self-worth, beliefs, and discovering their own \"truth\". ",
            "Their \"truth\" is what is right for them, what makes sense in their minds, and expressing these feelings in their work. In this instance, it was the combination of both quilting and writing. This combination takes place as a form of composition called \"critical making\" or depending on the research field, \"design thinking\" (see Newman). This form of composition goes deeper than words on paper. \"Critical making is positioned at the intersection of the \"scholarly\" work of thinking and the material work of making; it serves as a catalyst for design, embedded in a process of craft, material, and exploration\" (Schwartz, 2016), giving way to an open exchange of creativity and composition. Their focus is on making a bigger impact, embracing their differences, and creating a connection between what they write and what is their \"truth\". Anson (2014), indicates we rarely permit composition students with autonomous decision making about their writing. Conventionally, current traditional classrooms have assumed that students needed a set of rules for discourse to achieve polished, correct writing. Anneliese A. Singh, who did a quilting project with her college students called The Social Justice Quilt said \"the Social justice quilt supports a balance between two forces. One force looks back so that students can \"see\" themselves in the history and her-story of liberation. The second force looks forward so that they can see how they hold the products of liberation (e.g., opportunities, resources, access) in addition to holding the power to create change on behalf of others\" (2010).",

We were feeling a little desperate when one student offered a solution, volunteering an old white sheet that she did not need anymore if I would allow her to go to her dorm quickly and grab it.

When we think of the act of binding, or being bound as metaphor, Quilting Composition bound the class together in complicated material and immaterial ways. As hopefully demonstrated through some of the anecdotes you can find sprinkled throughout this webtext, we as a class were bound together differently: we weren't students and instructors in a writing classroom; we were a collective of writers and quilters working towards a common project. And, although the primary focus of this webtext is the class, it's also important to acknowledge how the roots of the class grew into an extensive undergraduate mentoring project that resulted in this publication. Besides helping the reader think about how to perform a similar project in their own classroom, this project also gives a glimpse into how undergraduate mentoring with students and faculty of color in rhetoric and writing studies can materialize. This webtext and its digital quilt are a collaborative mentoring project that developed over more than a year of sewing, discussing, writing, conference presentations and workshops, an all-expenses paid trip to Hawaii (!), eating pizza in Kelly's office, and sharing stories. ",
            "Building on the intimate and nuanced understanding of what mentoring looks like in rhetoric and composition through story in Eble and Gaillet's (2008) Stories of Mentoring, this story of mentoring is evidenced through its product, a student-driven research article. Thus, this article, our digital quilt, becomes an artifact, tool, and model for/how collaborative mentoring with first generation, undergraduate PGM students and faculty can look. In their recent article on Latinx mentoring in rhetoric and composition, \"Advocating Comadrismo,\" Ana Milena Ribero and Sonia Arellano (2019) argue, \"mentoring of people of color in rhetoric and composition can be the sort of activist practice that works against the hegemony of whiteness in writing studies and in academia\" (338). The digital quilt as rhetoric and composition mentoring praxis supports that call by disrupting traditional hierarchies of power and knowledge that predetermine who counts as author and expert in our field. It also builds an educational pathway to graduate school through earlier professionalization for first generation and students of color who would not have considered it an option prior to engaging in such work, further dismantling the hegemony of whiteness in academia. As scholars in rhetoric and composition and beyond continue to grapple with how to build a more equitable academy and the role of mentoring in supporting those goals, the digital quilt reminds us that sometimes one of our greatest undervalued resources are the students themselves.

As the concept was introduced, I couldn't see how quilting was going to benefit my writing abilities or even be a \"true\" representation of what a composition class was or should be. I was apprehensive about how executing the quilting project was going to, not only be relevant to my writing but if it was something that I was capable of producing. I did not know what a quilt truly was, other than a common answer from most of the students- a blanket. I had experience with crocheting and sewing, but my quilting experience was limited. At the beginning of this project, I do not feel that I fully understood the context for which a quilt could hold, the deep emotional meanings that it could represent, or the history it could tell, and quite frankly, I do not think most of my classmates did either. In the end, quilting was used as imagery and text, allowing our identities as diverse individuals and as a group, giving us an equal opportunity for recognition. ",
            "This particular GWAR class focused on the subject of cooperative argumentation. A class such as this, where the central focus was always on topics that were meant to push the students beyond a \"comfort zone,\" meant as a class, through our varying conflicting and agreeing opinions, we had to learn how to listen and understand the perspective of others. When writing did take place, it was composed of three short essays that focused on our experience as we moved into different stages of completing the quilt. Since the writing was tied into our experiences, the writing portion was more challenging for others, as some students had a more difficult time choosing what their passionate attachment would be.",
            "I grew up finding many ways to express myself- painting, drawing, crochet, and  writing. Writing and storytelling has been a passion of mine since I was a child, so I thought entering into this English class would feel familiar and complete a straight-to-the-point traditional argumentative essay on a topic that I wouldn't find myself particularly interested in. Sitting in my Professors class, the feeling of apprehensive, curiosity, and excitement was something I rarely felt in any of my college classes at that point. For me, writing is a creative outlet yet, being in college, it sometimes felt more like a chore. This unique perspective-quilting and writing- gave me a chance to feel that my perspectives were seen, just as other classmates felt theirs were. ",
            "I did not think the essay portion of the project would be particularly difficult but it was more challenging than I came to realize. The essay depended on the progress of completing my quilt block and given that I had a difficult time completing mine, my writing would feel like it was stalled. It felt frustrating because I think of myself as a creative person with too many \"passionate attachments\", and figured that writing would be the easiest part of the project. ",
            "I thought creating my own block would be the hardest part, but the hardest part came when it was time for all the students to come together and put each of our quilt pieces together to start making one quilt. To make the transition from an individual project to a group one easier, we opted for reading the papers of some of our classmates to figure out the best way to put the quilt pieces in an arrangement that we all agreed worked best together. When looking at another student's quilt block, many of the students had different perspectives on what that quilt block meant. But when we were able to read about that student's inspiration behind their quilt block, it helped us get a better idea of their experience with the world. To physically see the quilt only gives a piece of the story, in order to get a deeper understanding and connection with the work, you must also know the story behind it. ",
            "The experience of mixing quilting and writing was an eye-opener for a lot of students in the class, as we had discovered what seemed like an unconventional way of discussing diversity about ourselves and with each other. As we collectively sat together in class and talked about what each of our quilt pieces meant to us, it became more prominent that the importance of seeing our differences was even more important than seeing our similarities.",

I was in my second year of college and I was ready to be done with all my prerequisites, and this was one of the last ones I needed to complete. Being a Humanities and Communication major, I was used to writing essays and reading articles, so I wasn't too worried about this class. When Dr. Medina-López walked into the classroom, I could feel her scholarly yet fun energy, and I was already expecting to like this class. What I wasn't expecting was to open up the syllabus and see the words \"Cooperative Quilt Making.\" With a shy, and somewhat sly smile on her face, Dr. Medina-López told the class that we would be quilting this semester alongside our readings and essays. ",
            "At that moment, I could hear the disbelief from the class. No one was expecting this, and almost no one actually wanted to put the time and energy into sewing, especially if they had never sewed before. Dr. Medina-López promised that it would be fun, and said that no one had to have any prior sewing experience because she also didn't have any! Dr. Medina-López understood why some people would have reservations, and even said that she wouldn't have any hard feelings if people wanted to drop the class after finding out about the quilt. Although I was a little caught off-guard, I decided to stick it out and stay enrolled in her class. As time went on, we were told that our individual blocks were going to be over our passionate attachments. Since I knew I'd never get this type of opportunity in academia again, I knew I wanted to do mine on something fun.",
            "During the semester of this class, I was really into marathon-watching television shows with my roommate, and it just so happened that Sex and the City was the show I was watching the most at that time. My roommate suggested that I base my block on Sex and the City, and even offered to help me out of the design. After I decided on Sex and the City, I then had to figure out how I was going set up my block. I didn't want to add too much and run out of time to complete it, but I also wanted to make it interesting enough that it didn't blend into the other blocks. Since each character has a distinct hairstyle, I knew it would be easy to just distinguish them by their hairdos. The four women live in New York City, and they love to be out at night, so I decided to make my block out of black fabric and sew on skyscrapers out of gray fabric. And lastly, to make sure everyone who looked at the block knew exactly what my block was about, my roommate helped write the title of the show in pink fabric paint. With my plan drafted down on paper, I went out to buy a few supplies and started on my block.",
            "Out of everything in that class, finishing my block was the easiest part. Yes, it was slightly hard to learn how to thread a needle and to actually sew, but it was all an individual process, so I didn't have to worry about others not doing their part. Plus, I put a lot of time in my block, and I was really happy with how it turned out. The other steps of the project, however, included group work. After everyone was done with their blocks, we were assigned into groups of four to sew our blocks onto our groupmates.' Group work is interesting, especially when there's a groupmate sending multiple unnecessary messages in the group-text that was just created with all the other groupmates.",
            "There were a total of six groups, and once those six groups were finished sewing their blocks onto their group mates', we were supposed to get together with another group and sew our group of blocks onto their groups blocks. All of that was going pretty smooth, until one student in class had to take the entire quilt home with him so he could sew his block onto it. We were all fine with that, as long as he kept the quilt safe and had it back in class by the next day. At this point in the semester, the entire class has become very attached to our quilt, and we wanted to see the quilt through to the end. However, as the next class period began, that student who brought the quilt home was nowhere to be found, and the rest of us didn't know what to do. It was a quilting day, and we were on a tight schedule to finish before the end of the semester, but how could we sew if we didn't have the quilt? After an hour, and multiple emails and phone calls, the student shows up to class with the quilt in hand. Major crisis averted.",
            "The last step of the project was sewing the back onto the quilt. When it was time for that, we weren't sure if we had a big enough piece of fabric to fit the back. One student suggested that we used a sheet, and even offered to run home really quick and go get it. Deciding that was the best option, she went and got it. Since we wanted everyone to have an equal amount of sewing work, we each had to sew a twelve-inch seam around the quilt to sew it onto the back. This part turned out to be extra difficult, because it's hard getting flimsy needles to go through so much fabric. However, everyone else in class was done, all I had to do was sign the back and the quilt was complete.",
            "After each step of the quilt, we would have to write essays on our experiences. The first essay had me writing about the story behind my block, and why I was attached to the theme. The second essay discussed both the good and the bad of the process of having to work with others to assemble our blocks together. The final essay was about the entire experience of the class: how it was working with the entire class, what our goals and outcomes were, and how we felt about the final look of the quilt. ",
            "After we submitted every one of our essays, we would hold a class discussion and talk about what we wrote in our papers. It was fun and interesting to get to know the other students, and to see why they were attached to their passionate attachments. This was also where we would converse about how quilting would help with writing.",
            "Overall, I loved Dr. Medina-López's class. Quilting was a nice change from the boring tradition of only reading proper texts and writing essays. Not only did we get to do those things, but we were able to be creative in the process, which made our writings even better. To make matters even better, the quilt came out looking amazing, and I left that class feeling accomplished as a quilter and as a writer.",

            "In figure 8, Leslie Maldonado \"gets cozy\" with quilting composition in one of the many afternoons we spent in Kelly's office laughing, listening to music, sharing food, and working on this project. In this picture she is cutting pre-measured quilt squares for our half-day Quilting Composition workshop at the 2019 Conference on College Composition and Communication. ",
            "Unlike Alyssa and Giana, I was introduced to this project outside of the classroom. As the idea of attending graduate school became more important, I was seeking research opportunities that would allow me to practice my academic writing skills. As someone whose first language is not English, I always felt some sort of uneasiness when writing in academic settings. I enjoyed leisure writing and performed well when given tasks that allowed room for creative direction but felt apprehensive about writing processes taught in K-12 curriculums. Most writing assignments were unvarying, even in courses that were supposed to allow for creative freedom, the writing topics were unchanging. It wasn't until I became a part of this project that I saw writing through a different perspective. I had been under the impression that academic writing and all things related to composition and/or rhetoric were to remain \"scholarly.\" To me, scholarly excluded any creative forms of art which made up many of my interests in and outside of academia.",
            "After learning more about this project from Dr. Medina-Lopez, I was intrigued. In the beginning, I was, like many students in the course, unsure because I could not understand how quilting and writing could be comparable. As I began reading literature related to critical making, composition and multimodality, I was thrilled. I did face some challenges along the way that mostly stemmed from me not being in the course. Reading literature on social justice and textiles and the history of hypertextuality made me want to learn more about the meaning behind each block as well as each students' experience \"writing\" about a personal attachment in a non-traditional way. This was important to me as I had always wanted to be able to comfortably write in a non-traditional way and bring these forth in my scholarly work but had never been presented with the opportunity to do so.",
            "Even though I was not in the course I applied my new knowledge to personal experiences. I thought back to how my mom, who is a seamstress, had been teaching me about all of this without either of us being aware. Metaphorically, I had been learning about composition studies since the first time I assisted my mom with making a huanengo at the age of ten. Additionally, I learned that these among other textiles and/or other creative art is of value to academia. Recognizing this allows PGM students to feel confident in composition studies. Providing students with opportunities to take courses like these challenges composition pedagogy as we know it today while simultaneously working toward social justice in the classrooms.",

            "The quilters encourage all of our readers to \"pass on\" rasquache critical quilt making as social justice classroom praxis. Like Vanessa Kraemer Sohan (2015) reminds us, there are many connections between quilting and composing, and PGM have a rich history of using quiltmaking, \"as a vehicle to construct their own discourse(s)—a way to (re)write the material conditions of their lives\" (299). Introducing our students to these often overlooked activisms and encouraging them to build on that tradition offers a new way for us to align our composition curriculum with more socially just futures. ",
            "Our intention was to sew together a digital quilt that reflects our tangible quilt which is a metaphor for a theoretical quilting together of critical making in the composition classroom as rasquache maker project. This project decolonizes composition classroom theory and praxis on multiple distinct and thought-provoking levels, in hopes that it might propel forward the decolonial futures of composition studies. It contributes to a contemporary scholarly conversation about the rhetorical value of indigenous textiles (Haas, Arellano) as decolonial social justice projects. It also merges that conversation with classroom pedagogy, providing practical classroom tools for accessing the community epistemologies of PGM students and centers classroom activities around that knowledge. We look forward to more stories that not only tell, but also show similar projects in action! ",
