            "This project, \"Quilting Composition\" as we lovingly refer to it, is a multimodal project that spans years of scholarship, sewing, and social justice. With it we try to represent our experience: a physical/digital compilation of mixed media, mixed methods, mixed writers, theories, and identities. The digital quilt you see here represents a physical quilt that we sewed as part of an upper division writing in the disciplines class, and the physical quilt represents our diverse embodied realities. Our immediate goal with this project is to contribute to ongoing conversations about critical making as composition pedagogy and provide pedagogical and practical implications for employing critical making in the writing classroom. Our larger goal is to solidify the connections between critical making and social justice, advancing critical making as social justice classroom praxis that answers the pedagogical and curricular needs of diverse student populations (Austin & Oseguera, 2004).

            "Who are we? We are quilters; but we started as an assistant professor of composition studies, two students in an upper division writing in the disciplines course, a student interested in social justice and undergraduate research, and a computer science student skilled at coding. In becoming quilters we have each defined our roles and identities in relationship to scholarship, writing, and critical making. Like the individual blocks of our physical quilt, we maintain our agency and autonomy in our separate goals and identities while still coming together to inform this project. Respectful of these quilting lessons and outcomes, this webtext represents our individual voices and experiences. As this work will argue, part of reframing composition through social justice maker projects is to broaden the scope of who counts and what counts as composer, expert, and authority. Thus, this article is a practice in that very work. The authors represent a “quilting together,” if you will, of voices, experiences, and expertise. True to quilting etiquette, the authors refuse the traditional genre of standard edited academic article and instead allow their individual writing to maintain its own style. The article itself, then, is also “quilted composition:” four voices, ideas, and experiences sewn together by transitions, section breaks, and collaborative effort, bound by the conventions of an academic article, and pieced together through coded webtext. Our shifts in voice, style, tone, and ideas are purposeful, even if at times awkward. We give credit to individual voices when necessary and come together as one when our ideas converge. ",
            "This digital quilt explores “Quilting Composition” through research and reflection. Although we invite you to interact with the quilt in your own way, our roles in the project determine what we write about. Kelly covers her classroom praxis. Leslie provides the history of quilting and textile arts and their relationship to rhetoric and composition, emphasizing their usefulness as social justice projects. Giana discusses textile arts and maker projects as composition classroom pedagogy, and her experience as a student and researcher. Alyssa looks at how quilting composition is social justice in practice, and reflects on the project. Erik codes our writing together into a digital quilt. We provide observations from our experiences throughout, as students, instructors, and researchers. Our broad goal is to show how quilting, when contextualized as rasquache maker project, is useful for teaching students about writing, but also for encouraging them to see the risks and rewards of writing in its myriad forms as a tool for social justice and advocacy.",

            "Kelly’s Story: It was Semester’s Eve in spring of 2018 and I sat facing my computer: Should I make the syllabus live now, or wait until we meet tomorrow? I’m guessing this is a familiar place for all instructors, but the spring of 2018 was especially poignant for me because somewhere between October 2017 and January 2018 I embarked on a crazy composition classroom adventure: I decided we would be quilting. Like, really quilting. Fabric, needles, thread—the whole thing. And not just once or twice, either: every week for the duration of the semester we would work towards the goal of making a class quilt. I scoured the names of the 26 students who were about to become part of my project. Should I wait until the students are in the classroom on the first day to spring the quilt idea? I decided to publish the materials early, so the students could see what to expect. Within two hours three students had dropped. By the end of the day the roster had shifted significantly. Students dropped, panicked last minuters added, and a core of the strong (or those that didn’t bother to check) held fast. There was a low din when I entered the classroom the next day. It slowed as I started taking off my jacket and preparing. At 3:00 pm I began to introduce myself and welcome everyone to the class. I hadn’t even broken into the syllabus when a hand shot up. “Yes?” I said, nervously, “I’m sorry,” said the student, “are we really going to make a quilt in this class? This is GWAR right?” “Yes,” I paused longer than I should have, “this is GWAR. And we’re making a quilt.” Excited chatter as students turned to each other in disbelief. I laughed and said, “hear me out…” By the end of the two-hour class meeting everyone—myself included! - was skeptical, but on board. We were doing it! ",

            "Where did this idea come from? And how did it take shape as a social justice maker project? I used project-based and maker-based learning in my classes for years, but in fall of 2017 I attended a maker session at the Feminisms and Rhetorics conference led by Sonia Arellano where she discussed her own social justice quilting projects and took us through a bit of her inspiring work. Something clicked: what if instead of individual maker projects we worked towards a collaborative class project? Quilting seemed like the perfect medium to explore this idea. After Arellano’s presentation, I started researching other sewing for social justice and maker projects across rhetoric and composition. I found inspiration in the syllabi of Malea Powell (2014), Sonia Arellano, and Jennifer Sano-Franchini (2019), and the theoretical work of Angela Haas (2012), Matt Ratto and Megan Boler (2014), Jodi Shipka (2011), and David Sheridan, Jim Ridolfo, and Anthony Michel (2012), who all encourage us to extend our definition of writing (and research) to include critical making. I also turned to my own experiences for inspiration. My dad raised me with a “fix it or make it” mentality that left a large streak of rasquachismo in me that finds its way into my academic work. Tomás Ybarra-Frausto (1989), theorizes rasquachismo as “an underdog perspective - a view from los de abajo. An attitude rooted in resourcefulness and adaptability yet mindful of stance and style” (p. 5). He argues that rasquachismo is “visceral,” an “aesthetic display projecting a sort of visual biculturalism.” Rasquache is both embodied as a sensibility (visceral) and an “aesthetic,” something visible and visual. It is more than just a method for creating art, rasquache is a theory and analysis of how and why art is made. A rasquache methodology accounts for both the invisible and the visible by attaching sensibility and aesthetic to the work of researching, making methodology tangible both as a bodily practice and visible representation of how rhetoric and composition research proceeds. Sarah Lowndes (2016) connects DIY projects back to rasquache, although she doesn’t name it as such, stating, “DIY activities are often carried out using an economy of means and materials, and exhibit what could be called an aesthetic of necessity” (p. 263). I approached the quilt through rasquachismo, as I do most things.",
            "As I continued my search on quilting, critical making, and social justice, I found projects doing similar work here in the US, like the Social Justice Sewing Academy, The Migrant Quilt Project, and various work featured in Marsha MacDowell, et al.’s (2016) Quilts and Human Rights. I started thinking about the power of textile production as social action in its myriad forms, but I also started thinking about Cooperative Argumentation (Makau & Marty, 2001): the theoretical underpinnings for my department’s GWAR class, and how it encourages students to engage the deliberative process as a framework for decision making. Quilting seemed to accomplish these multiple and diverse goals: It presented a way for students to work both individually (on their own quilt block) and as a group (to bring the whole quilt together). The work they engage in would help them make tangible the labor of research, the production of rhetorical artifacts, and see themselves as dynamic pieces of larger systems of labor, production, and audience. It also opened space for them to engage rhetoric in activism and consider the intersection of social justice and composing.",
            "With these ideas in mind, I hatched the plan of the quilt. As a class, we would spend all semester making a quilt.  The project would grow and change from an individual, to small group, to large group project. While we made the quilt, we’d talk about research, writing, rhetoric, social justice, and advocacy through the framework of cooperative argumentation.",

            "Quilting for social justice is rooted in the communities of people of the global majority (PGM) (see MacDowell 2016) (the authors use the more accurate PGM to decenter whiteness and challenge the demographic inaccuracy of “minority”). As a community of quilters we were eager to explore that history and transfer it to our project. One of our first observations was how quilting asks that you not be afraid to take up a sharp object (needle) and poke holes in what existed before to make new combinations through stitching, patching, and threading together. Many of our classroom conversations centered on these observations and their associated metaphors: If the pen is our needle, how do we make it just as sharp? If the needle is the pen, what is the thread? ",
            "Textiles have had and continue to play a prominent role in the lives of ethnic communities: wampum, huipiles, slave quilts and the AIDS Memorial Quilt (see Blair and Michel) are just a few common examples. Indigenous communities “employed wampum belts as hypertextual technologies—as wampum belts have extended human memories and inherited knowledges through interconnected, nonlinear designs and associative storage and retrieval methods—long before the “discovery” of “Western hypertext” (Haas, 2007, p. 77). This positions Indigenous people as the “first known skilled multimedia workers and intellectuals in the Americas” (Haas, 2007, p. 78). To this community the “wampum is a living rhetoric that communicates relationship between two or more parties” as it has “serve[d] as a sign of technology that has been used to record hundreds of years of alliances within tribes, between tribes, and between the tribal governments and colonial government” (Haas, 2007, p. 78). Wampum belts “extend human memories of inherited knowledge via interconnected, nonlinear designs with associative message storage and retrieval methods” (Haas, 2007, p. 80-81).",
            "Like wampum, huipiles—a Guatemalan indigenous hand-embroidered textile and a traditional garment— “can reveal age, sex, status, or it can state degrees of group membership and participation in different systems of beliefs, concealing individual identities in military uniforms or religious robes” (Odland, 2006, p. 2). Since indigenous Guatemalan artists create huipiles with the purpose of being read, one can argue that the makers of these textiles write through multimodal textiles to share a message with readers, members of the community who can decode the symbols present in the textile. Odland supports Haas’ research on wampum, further showing that indigenous communities have extensive traditions of multimodality. Odland (2006) states that “because each community has developed its own style, form, pattern, and color that serve as symbols of identity and meaning, we can assume that the Maya have practiced their weaving traditions for a long time” (p. 2). The huipil remains a “cloth [with] unlimited potential for communication graphically and emblematically” (Odland, 2006, p. 2). ",
            "Similar to cultural histories sewn into wampum and huipiles, quilts became an important piece of the fight against slavery in the United States. Organizers of the Underground Railroad quilted slave codes into quilts to help the enslaved navigate their way to freedom. In Hidden in Plain View: A Secret Story of Quilts and the Underground Railroad, authors Jacqueline Tobin and Raymond G. Dobard (2000) share their findings from a discussion with Ozella McDaniel Williams, a quilt maker from South Carolina. During the interview Williams “told researchers that she memorized a secret code passed down by her ancestors that was used by the quilt makers before the Civil War to offer discreet clues to slaves who were trying to escape to freedom in the North” (p. 44).  Tobin and Dobard (2000) “believe that particular quilt squares which showed wrenches in a particular pattern or pointed in a particular direction were hung outside of slave housing to signal other slaves it was time to gather their tools and other belongings and try to escape” (p. 44). ",
            "Wampum, huipiles, and slave quilts, among other textile forms of resistance, extend the fight for equity and justice for PGM communities. As a collective of social justice quilters, we thought about the history of textiles metaphorically as our thread: how can we use this history of active resistance to stitch together our own activisms? What other threads of resistance and activism could we bring together in our quilt and in our writing?",

            "Fabric is the foundation of the quilt. In essence, it is the quilt. Or, at least, it is what makes the tangible existence of the quilt possible.

This section covers the practicalities of planning and scheduling, and how  our institutional structure made this project possible. ",
            "(Kelly) The first thing I have to admit for this section is that I am blessed with long class meeting times, and so anyone thinking of adopting a similar project in their classroom will need to account for their classroom contact hours. GWAR is a four credit class that meets twice a week for two hours each meeting. I had four hours every week to split between covering course content and working on the quilt project. I split the two evenly: during our first two-hour class meeting of the week (Tuesday), we would do “typical” classroom activities: discuss assigned readings and materials, small and large group activities, peer reviews and workshops, and other supporting work. Tuesdays, in other words, were our content days. This worked well. Usually students (and instructors!) are more focused and energized during the beginning of the week, and it also gave students (and me!) a weekend to prep for a heavy day of content. ",
            "Thursdays, our second meeting of the week, became quilting days, or our “applied learning” days. The assignment sequence dictated the actual quilting activities for each quilting day (see “Pins”), which were further guided through discussion of transfer from the tangible material moves we were making to create our quilt and the content we had covered the previous Tuesday. I encouraged students to dialogue with each other about their quilt process, to collaborate and work as a collective, and also to bring in key themes, ideas, and metaphors from our course content. But, as much as I encouraged students to see these days as an extension and practice of our learning, I also wanted to emphasize them as days for self-care, reflection and meditation, mindfulness, and attention to mental health. I loved when students were eagerly engaged in conversations about how quilting mapped onto our learning, but I also equally enjoyed the days we spent sewing quietly to a playlist. ",
            "For one student, who quilted the “Break the Stigma” square, the purposeful attention to mental health and self care was an important part of the class because it reflected her chosen activism: mental health awareness. But, it wasn’t just her that found these sewing days helpful. A number of my students commented on how much they looked forward to having time built into their busy schedules to focus on a relaxing and meditative activity. As we continue to think about how to make our classrooms more safe and equitable spaces, and how that in turn helps build a more mindful society, making time for wellness into our course structure increasingly emerges as a valuable practice (see for example Grese Owens et al, 2015). Splitting my course structure into content days and sewing days allowed me to tap into that potential, and our sewing days became the highlight of the week, every week. ",

Not only were they willing to donate two giant totes of fabric, two members of the guild also came to the class to guest lecture on how to get started with quilting and shared some of their art quilts with the students. Engaging the local community helped the quilt project feel that much more real. Our friends at the guild even came back to visit us once we finished the quilt.
